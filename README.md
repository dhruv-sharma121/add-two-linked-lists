# 📘 RAGMind AI

### AI-Powered Multi-PDF Study Assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

RAGMind AI is an intelligent AI-powered study assistant that allows users to upload multiple PDF documents and ask questions from them using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The system uses semantic search, vector embeddings, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate answers, summaries, and viva preparation content from uploaded PDFs.

🧩 How RAGMind AI Works
PDFs are uploaded by the user
Text is extracted from documents
Text is split into smaller chunks
Chunks are converted into embeddings
Embeddings are stored in FAISS vector database
User query is converted into embedding
Semantic similarity search retrieves relevant chunks
Retrieved chunks are passed to Groq LLM
LLM generates final answer
📈 Future Improvements
Conversational Chat Memory
Source Citation with Page Numbers
OCR Support for Scanned PDFs
Voice Interaction
Flashcard Generator
MCQ Generation
ChatGPT-like UI
Multi-language Support
